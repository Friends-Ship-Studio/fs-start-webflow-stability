# fs-start-webflow-stability

This is a starter template for new **Webflow** projects that require custom code — with a focus on **stability**.

It is created and maintained by @kkilat and Friends Ship Studio for use in internal and client projects. However, it is open source with an MIT license, so you are free to use it for any personal or commercial projects if you find it helpful — just remember to update or remove the `LICENSE`, as applicable.

For Webflow projects with other needs needs, I will be creating additional starter templates with the following areas of focus:
- **Simplicity**
- **Scalability**
